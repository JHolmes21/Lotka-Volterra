# Lotka-Volterra
This is part of the code used for my final year project for my master's in physics at the University of Manchester. It is an analysis of the Lotka-Volterra equations for random matrices with generalised correlations.

The purpose of the project was to consider the effects of different correlations within an interaction matrix on the dynamics of an ecosystem. A more detailed description of the project can be found within the project report
